Some-bodies are listening, too
Not just us

Something has been changing

There is an old persimmon tree nearby
In may, tiny yellow flowers fall like a rain shower
Listening to it, it felt like it was raining
Some stray cats come to drink water under the tree
She placed several white bowls of water
When flowers fall into the empty bowl, it made a resonated sound 

How's the weather there? 
I am not there but… 
are you there? 

Some-bodies are listening, too.
Not just us

I’ve been seated on the stone wall over six years
I keep letting the sound I hear flow somewhere. 
Waiting 
Forgetting that I’m waiting
Remaining here 

Every dawn, i witness the first call of birds 
How long has passed?
It would continue
Vanishing… 
Disconnecting and then reconnecting
It is about to pour
How wide the window is open
Can you see that? 
It's coming closer 
It is hitting upon itself
Did you see it? 
You’d better to focus on one thing first
What you are seeing

Some-bodies are listening, too
Not just us

I’m in front of the tunnel 
The tunnel has open ends
Something passes through making the inside resonate

drop, drop

Water drops falling 

knock, knock, knock

Sounds strange, huh?

Gero means beside the road 
That simple  
I have lived for 87 years in this village
Yang, my family name

I heard there was a temple near the tunnel 
and that the temple had a spring
I was the coachman driving the carriage, 
I heard that story from an old woman i met 
The water never gets dried up
leaking through the tunnel
My aunt was hit by a car on the road above and died
Byeonyoung-ro, that’s the name of it
meaning thriving road

There are many memorial stones in the village
They were placed to remember
Wishing the memory firm, like stone.
Nonetheless
On the stone, the green moss starts to settle
and growing little by little, eroding the stone
My face, weathered with age spots
The stone, covered with green moss
My face is a memory

My words sound scattered
Where do they all disappear to?

Some-bodies are listening, too.
Not just us

Sound needs a space to be resonated
to be heard
Where is here? 
Here, time seems to flow differently
or maybe it doesn’t feel like it’s flowing at all
Perhaps the idea of flowing is an illusion
We are just listening
Each listeners brought their own time
Like something from far away
Almost imperceptible

Once again, i dip my ears into the stream
It’s never the same stream
