some-bodies are listening here  
we are not the only listeners...  

something has been changing  

there is an old persimmon tree nearby  
in may small and yellow persimmon flowers used to fall down  
as it sounded like rain, i thought it was raining  
some stray cats come here to drink water under the tree  
she placed several water bowls  
when flowers fell down in the empty bowl, it resonated  

how's the weather there?  

i am not there but  

are you there?  

some-bodies are listening here  
we are not the only listeners...  

i’ve been seated on the stone wall  
since nearly 6 years ago  

waiting...  
forgetting  
remaining  

every dawn, i witness the first calling of birds  

how long has passed?  

it would continue  

vanishing...  

disconnecting and then reconnecting  

it is about to pour  

how wide is the window open?  

can you see it?  

it's coming closer  

all will pass by  

it is hitting upon itself  

did you see it?  

i suggest you to focus on one thing first  

what you are seeing at  

some-bodies are listening here  

we are not the only listeners...  

i am watching a big stone cracked under the riverside  

gero means beside the road. that simple.  

i have lived for 87 years in this village  

my family name, Yang  

there are many memorial stones here  

they are for remembrance  

wishing rigid memory like a stone  

nontheless  

on the stone, the green moss starts gets seated  

and growing little by little, breaking the stone  

black mushrooms bloom on my face  

the green moss bloom on the memorial stone  

my face is a memory  

i was told that there is a well near a small temple  

the water never gets dried up  

leaking through the tunnel  

dropdrop  

water leaking  

knockknock knock  

sounds strange, huh?  

my words sound scattered  

my aunt was hit by a car on the road above and died  

thriving road, that’s the name of it  

tunnel has open-end and something passes  

making tunnel resonating inside  

some-bodies are listening here  

we are not the only listener...  

sound needs a space to be resonated  

here time seems to be flowing differently  

or it doesn’t feel like flowing at all  

maybe flowing is a delusion  

we just listen  

all listeners here came with a different time  

like a far away  

almost imperceptible  

i dip my ears into this stream again  

never the same the stream
